# Job Boards
## Description
A collection of job boards in use by specific companies. This project lives in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iWLIGaxjBy-KJhsREwL5XL1-T2OxvhLMG7D4IZX8dPs).

## Contributing
Make a copy from the google sheet and make your changes. Open a new [issue](https://github.com/boom100100/job_boards/issues) linking to your copy and tag @boom100100. Make sure your copy is publicly viewable or inquire within for my email address for more limited sharing.

## Learnings
- Don't even bother trying to automate Workday (wd1, wd3, and wd5) career site company names with JS or HTML.
